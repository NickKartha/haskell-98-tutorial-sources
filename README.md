A Gentle Introduction to Haskell, Version 98 - and climbing?
This is the source for the official Haskell tutorial. I shall try updating this repository to the latest Haskell 2020.

How can we do things in minimal lines of code? Less lines, more readable. Easy.

\[Aaron has] been taking notes from it, but \[he's] worried parts may be obsolete (and they are), and I want to track the changes and perhaps accept updates. Perhaps, this version can be used to update the tutorial at haskell.org/tutorial

There is a more official repo from Haskell team.

Both Paul Hudak and John Peterson are deceased.

Perhaps I should attempt to contact Joseph Fasel or Reuben Thomas.
